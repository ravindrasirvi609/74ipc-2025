## How It Works Now

1. **User submits registration form**
2. **API creates Cashfree payment order** (working ✅)
3. **Frontend receives payment session ID** (working ✅)
4. **Payment checkout process** (now fixed ✅):
   - Try Cashfree SDK v3 checkout (preferred)
   - If fails, try SDK v2 redirect
   - If fails, use direct payment URL
   - If fails, construct payment URL and redirect

## Expected Result

After these fixes, when a user completes the registration form:

1. ✅ Registration is created successfully
2. ✅ Payment session is created with Cashfree
3. ✅ Payment capture screen/modal will now appear
4. ✅ User can complete payment
5. ✅ User is redirected to success/failure page

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Registration form submission works
- [ ] Payment session is created (check console logs)
- [ ] Payment capture screen appears
- [ ] Payment can be completed
- [ ] Success/failure redirects work properly

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Debug component only shows in development mode
- Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure payment capture works
- Proper error handling provides good user experience
